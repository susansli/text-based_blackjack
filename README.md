# Text-Based Blackjack (21)

This is a terminal-based implementation of Blackjack. Built with Python, players play against the computer (acting as the dealer). Players have the option to fold, stand, or hit each turn. The game also keeps track of the player's money as well as win count.

Originally created for BCIT CST's COMP1510 course.

### How to Play

Run blackjack.py with Python on the terminal!
